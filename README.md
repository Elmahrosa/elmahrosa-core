# 🏛️ elmahrosa-core

**The Central Nervous System of the Elmahrosa Sovereign Ecosystem.**

`elmahrosa-core` is the master registry and governance anchor for all repositories within the Elmahrosa organization. It defines the relationships, compliance standards, and audit protocols that transform isolated applications into a unified, state-grade **Sovereign Software Factory**.

## 🛠 Core Functions

### 1. Registry Management
Every project in the ecosystem must be registered in the `ecosystem-map.json`. This ensures that dependencies (like Identity and Payments) are correctly linked across borders.

### 2. Institutional Governance
This repo hosts the **Global TEOS Constitution**. Every sub-project pulls governance rules from here to ensure that "Code is Law" and that law is compliant with both local and global regulations.

### 3. Centralized Audit Aggregation
While each repo maintains its own `/audit` logs, `elmahrosa-core` provides the tooling to aggregate these logs into a single, immutable proof of transparency for regulators and international partners.
